# Number Patterns:

This code generates various patterns of number triangles with different alignments and directions. Here's a breakdown of each section:

1. **Increasing Numbers Triangle**:

   Prints a triangle with numbers increasing from 1 to `n` on each row.

3. **Decreasing Numbers Triangle**:

   Prints a triangle with numbers decreasing from `n` to 1 on each row.

5. **Left-aligned Increasing Numbers Triangle**:

   Prints an increasing numbers triangle but left-aligned with leading spaces to form a left-aligned triangle.

7. **Left-aligned Decreasing Numbers Triangle**:

   Prints a decreasing numbers triangle but left-aligned with leading spaces to form a left-aligned triangle.

9. **Left-aligned Decreasing Numbers Triangle (Reversed)**:

   Prints a decreasing numbers triangle but left-aligned and with numbers in reverse order.

11. **Right-aligned Decreasing Numbers Triangle**:

    Prints a decreasing numbers triangle right-aligned with trailing spaces to form a right-aligned triangle.

13. **Right-aligned Decreasing Numbers Triangle (Grouped)**:

    Prints a decreasing numbers triangle right-aligned and grouped together.

15. **Right-aligned Decreasing Numbers Triangle (Grouped, Reversed)**:

    Prints a decreasing numbers triangle right-aligned, grouped together, and with numbers in reverse order.

Each section modifies the alignment, direction, and grouping of the numbers to create different visual patterns using nested loops and string manipulation.
